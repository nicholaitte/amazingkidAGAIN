Hello there! I'm Nicholaitte and I'm currently a sophomore in college studying electronics engineering. 
Ever since I was a teenager, I've been wanting to learn how to code because to be honest seeing codes in front of a computer
seem pretty cool and if you're a programmer, you look like an intelligent person because you're doing what most people can't do.
Anyway, some of the things I do during my free time when I'm not studying is to read (books, articles, almanacs, heck even atlas) and to watch
YouTube videos (the more it is random, the better). One time instead of studying for an exam, I just watched different birthing of animals.
Moreover, some of my interests outside my field is geography. Geography really has a special place to my heart because you've got to learn
different beutiful places around the earth. One of my goals is to make my own sattelite to map different things around the world. 
For now, I'll just work hard and continue my battle to become an engineer of the future. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. See ya!
